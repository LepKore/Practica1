# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This repository contains a small React 18 + Vite storefront. Source code lives in `src/`: `main.jsx` mounts the app, `App.jsx` owns application state and data loading, `ProductCard.jsx` renders product cards, `Cart.jsx` renders the cart panel, and `App.css` contains global styling. Static entry files are `index.html` and `vite.config.js`. `errores.md` is the running log of the bugs found and fixed in this exercise, with the symptom, the responsible file and line, and the applied fix for each one. Build output is generated in `dist/` and must not be committed. Dependencies live in `node_modules/` and are restored with `npm i`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

Use these commands from the repository root:

```bash
npm i
```

Installs dependencies from `package-lock.json`.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Starts the Vite development server, usually at `http://localhost:5173/`.

```bash
npm run build
```

Creates the production build in `dist/`.

```bash
npm run preview
```

Serves the production build locally for a final check.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Write React components as function components in `.jsx` files. Use PascalCase for components (`ProductCard`, `Cart`) and camelCase for state, functions, and props (`addToCart`, `visibleProducts`). Keep indentation at two spaces and omit semicolons to match the current code. Quoting follows the host language: single quotes in JavaScript (`'beauty'`, `'Agregar'`), double quotes in JSX attributes and in `src/App.css`. Keep styles in `src/App.css` unless a larger feature justifies splitting files.

## Testing Guidelines

No automated test framework is configured yet. For now, verify changes manually with `npm run dev` and run `npm run build` before committing. If tests are added later, prefer Vitest with React Testing Library and name files as `*.test.jsx` beside the component being tested.

## Known Pitfalls

The storefront reads live product data from `https://dummyjson.com/products` at runtime, so there is no offline fallback. Without network access the app stays on the loading state and shows no products or errors. When verifying a change, confirm the request actually succeeded before concluding the UI is broken. `src/App.jsx` also filters the fetched results a second time on both category and search text, so a product can be excluded client-side even when the API returned it.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

The existing history uses short Spanish commit messages such as `arreglos` and `Ignorar archivos generados y documentos markdown`. Keep commits concise and action-oriented, for example `Corregir calculo del carrito`. Pull requests should include a short description, manual verification steps, and screenshots for visible UI changes.

## Security & Configuration Tips

Do not commit generated folders or local environment files. Markdown files are ignored by default, with exceptions for `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `errores.md`, and everything under `/.agents/` and `/.contexto/` — those last two hold the project skills and the generated project context, which are documentation and therefore tracked. `errores.md` is the running log of the bugs fixed in this exercise.
